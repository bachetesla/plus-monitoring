- **Real-time Metrics**: Collect and display real-time metrics to track the health and performance of each service.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts to notify administrators of any issues or anomalies in the monitored services.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale effortlessly to accommodate growing monitoring needs.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deployable in Kubernetes clusters with Helm charts for simplified installation.

## Components

The Plus Monitoring System consists of the following components:

- **Main Application**: The core monitoring application responsible for collecting metrics and managing health checks.
- **Service Modules**: Individual modules for monitoring specific services like RabbitMQ, MySQL, Redis, etc.
- **Configuration**: YAML configuration files to define the services to be monitored and their parameters.
- **Helm Charts**: Helm charts for deploying the monitoring system in Kubernetes clusters.
- **Prometheus**: Integrated with Prometheus for metrics collection and storage.
- **Grafana**: Integrated with Grafana for visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster configured and running.
- Helm installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Access to the Prometheus and Grafana services.

### Installation

1. Clone the Plus Monitoring System repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/plus-monitoring.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `charts` directory:

   ```bash
   cd plus-monitoring/charts

   ```bash
   helm install plus-monitoring .
   ```

4. Access Prometheus and Grafana dashboards using their respective URLs.

### Configuration

1. Customize the `values.yml` file to configure deployment settings such as image repository, service ports, etc.

2. Update the `conf.yml` file to define the services to be monitored, their check intervals, authentication details, etc.

### Creating Dashboards

1. Access the Grafana dashboard using the provided URL.

2. Log in to Grafana using the default credentials (admin/admin).

3. Configure data sources to connect Grafana to Prometheus.

4. Create custom dashboards using the collected metrics to visualize the health and performance of monitored services.

### Monitoring Services

1. Add new services to be monitored by updating the `conf.yml` file with the required configuration details.

2. Ensure that the service modules are correctly implemented and integrated into the monitoring system.

3. Deploy the updated configuration using Helm to apply changes to the monitoring system.
